batteryCharger
--------------

This python script uses a lab power supply that is controlled using sigrok. The cell temperature is supervised using a USB temperature sensor. Th script can run on a RaspberryPi.
For Lithium Ion Batteries the constant current - constant voltage (CC-CV) charging method is used. The charging ends if the cell heats up to much or if the charging current drops below the configured limit. The charging current can also be configured.
For Ni-MH Cells the charging voltage is monitored for a drop in voltage.
